    "# **Types of Machine Learning**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Machine learning is categorized into three main types based on how the model learns from data:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Supervised Learning**\r\n",
    "- **Unsupervised Learning**\r\n",
    "- **Reinforcement Learning**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "---\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## **1. Supervised Learning**\r\n",
    "- The model learns from labeled data, meaning each input has a corresponding correct output.\r\n",
    "- It makes predictions based on past examples.\r\n",
    "- It is used for tasks like spam detection, fraud detection, and medical diagnosis.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### **Supervised Learning is further divided into:**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### **(i) Regression**\r\n",
    "- Used when the output is a continuous numerical value.\r\n",
    "- **Example:** Predicting house prices based on size, location, etc.\r\n",
    "- **Algorithms:** Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Decision Trees, etc.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### **(ii) Classification**\r\n",
    "- Used when the output is categorical (belongs to a specific class).\r\n",
    "- **Example:** Classifying emails as spam or not spam.\r\n",
    "- **Algorithms:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), etc.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "---\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## **2. Unsupervised Learning**\r\n",
    "- The model learns from unlabeled data (without predefined outputs).\r\n",
    "- It identifies patterns and structures in the data.\r\n",
    "- Used for clustering and association tasks.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### **Examples:**\r\n",
    "- **Clustering:** Grouping customers based on shopping behavior (K-Means, DBSCAN).\r\n",
    "- **Association Rule Learning:** Finding relationships in data, like market basket analysis (Apriori, FP-Growth).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "---\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## **3. Reinforcement Learning**\r\n",
    "- The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.\r\n",
    "- It is used in robotics, gaming (like AlphaGo), and self-driving cars.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### **Examples:**\r\n",
    "- Training a robot to walk.\r\n",
    "- Optimizing a stock trading strategy.\r\n",
    "- AI playing chess or Go.\r\n"

    "# Machine Learning Methodology\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## **1. Problem Analysis:**\r\n",
    "- Define the problem clearly (classification, regression, clustering, etc.).\r\n",
    "- Understand the business or domain context.\r\n",
    "- Identify success metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## **2. Data Collection:**\r\n",
    "- Gather relevant datasets from various sources (databases, APIs, web scraping, etc.).\r\n",
    "- Ensure data is sufficient, diverse, and representative of the problem domain.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## **3. Data Preprocessing:**\r\n",
    "- Handle missing values (imputation, removal).\r\n",
    "- Normalize or standardize data.\r\n",
    "- Encode categorical features.\r\n",
    "- Remove duplicates and handle outliers.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## **4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**\r\n",
    "- Visualize data distributions, correlations, and patterns.\r\n",
    "- Identify feature importance and relationships.\r\n",
    "- Detect data imbalances that may require handling.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## **5. Model Selection & Training:**\r\n",
    "- Choose the right algorithm based on the problem type.\r\n",
    "- Split data into training, validation, and test sets.\r\n",
    "- Train the model using appropriate hyperparameters.\r\n",
    "- **Data Splitting Example:**  \r\n",
    "  - `X_train` (80% of X), `X_test` (20% of X)  \r\n",
    "  - `y_train` (80% of y), `y_test` (20% of y)  \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## **6. Model Evaluation & Optimization:**\r\n",
    "- Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, RMSE, etc.\r\n",
    "- Perform hyperparameter tuning (Grid Search, Random Search).\r\n",
    "- Handle overfitting with regularization, dropout, or cross-validation.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## **7. Deployment & Monitoring:**\r\n",
    "- Deploy the model to production (API, cloud, embedded system).\r\n",
    "- Continuously monitor model performance and retrain if needed.\r\n",
    "- Handle data drift and ensure model fairness.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
